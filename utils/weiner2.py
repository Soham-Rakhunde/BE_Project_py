    The Wiener filter operates by fitting a functional form to the PSD::
       PSD = P_S + P_N
    The resulting frequency-space filter is given by::
       Phi = P_S / (P_S + P_N)
    This entire operation is equivalent to a kernel smoothing by a
    kernel whose Fourier transform is Phi.
    Choosing Signal/Noise Parameters
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    the arguments ``signal_guess`` and ``noise_guess`` specify the initial
    guess for the characteristics of signal and noise used in the minimization.
    They are generally expected to be tuples, and the meaning varies depending
    on the form of signal and noise used.  For ``gaussian``, the params are
    (amplitude, width).  For ``flat``, the params are (amplitude,).
